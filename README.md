## Prerequisites

You must have at least python 3 installed. Jupyter should also be installed 
if you want to view the jupyter notebooks.

```zsh
pip install metrolopy
```


## Structure

We have two main folders, one has metrolopy for terminal python if
plots are not required. 
The other folder uses jupyter notebook,
which we can use a web browser or an IDE like 
vscode to interact with it.

Of course, you can just use jupyter notebook all the time with vscode.
I have a particular liking for vim, that's why I split it up like that.
